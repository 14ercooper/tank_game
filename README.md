The basic idea behind this is "Wii Tanks but it's a bullet hell and the enemies are ghosts".

If you want to play the game, download the source and compile using C++17 and SFML. All the headers and implementation files need to be added to the executable, and the fonts/images/etc need to be in the game_resources folder (which is located in the same folder as the executable (or execution environment).

I might release some precompiled buids in the future, but I'm not entirely sure yet.
