The basic idea behind this is "Wii Tanks but it's a bullet hell and the enemies are ghosts".

If you want to play the game, download the source and compile using C++17 and SFML. All the headers and implementation files need to be added to the executable, and the fonts/images/etc need to be in the same folder as the executable.

I might extend the game a bit in the future, might release some precompiled builds, I don't know yet. We'll see.
